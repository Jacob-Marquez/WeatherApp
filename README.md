# WeatherApp
It is a simple web app where the user inputs the location and receives the weather forecast for the next five days. The user can then reset and enter in another location. I used Flask with Python for the backend and then HTML and CSS for the frontend. I gathered weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API for Python.
